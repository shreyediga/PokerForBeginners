            <h2 class="city city-athens">Rule of 4</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
           A good way to calculate your Pot Equity is by the Rules of 4. Using the Rules of 4, you can quickly approximate what your odds are of winning a hand is.</br></br>
           Rule of 4:</br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If we have N outs and 2 cards left to see, the probablity we make our draw is 4N%</br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If we have N outs, the probablity we make our draw on the next card is 2N%</br></br>
           <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("3").innerHTML="You have an open-ended straight draw and a flush draw, you would have 15 outs, so the odds you would hit your draw is 60% by the river and 30% on your next turn."'><img src="rule4exp.png"></button>
           Click on example to see the answer

        <p>
            <h2 class="city city-athens">Pot Equity</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pot Equity - Hero's share of the pot based on how often their hand will be the best by the river(It is the probability that we will win).</br></br>
            <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("2").innerHTML="Before you see the flop, Hero has an 82% chance of winning, but post-flop, Villian has about a 36% chance of winning, dropping Hero to around 62%."'><img src="equityexp.png"></button>
            Click on example for explanation
            <p id="2"> </p><br></br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pot Odds - The ratio of the pot as it currently stands to Hero's investment to see the next card (When calling a bet to see the next card, we want to make sure it would be profitable).</br>
            <img src="potodds.png">

        <p>
            <h2 class="city city-athens">Fold Equity</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fold Equity - The % of the time Hero wins the pot by getting everyone to fold. If everyone folds, you end up winning the blinds, which at the end of the day, is still a good profit if you can steal the blinds a lot.</br>
            If we assume that each person has about an 88% chance of folding to calculate the chance that N players fold after you are (.88)^N.</br>
            Example:</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If Hero raises from UG in hopes of everyone folding, it is (.88)^5 = 52.8%, but Hero raising from BU to get everyone to fold is (.88)^2 = 77.4%.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h2 class="city city-athens">Required Fold Equity</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Required Fold Equity is used to steal the blinds or bluff a weak hand.</br>
            Formula for RFE:</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<img src="rfe.png"></br>
            <img src="rfeexmp.png"></br>
            Sometimes even if our RFE is higher than our RFE, we may bet due to other factors like having a good hand or the other players aren't as skilled and don't notice you trying to steal the blinds.
